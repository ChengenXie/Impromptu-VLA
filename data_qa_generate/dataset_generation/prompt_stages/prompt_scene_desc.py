SCENE_DESC_PROMPT = """You are an expert in Driving Scene analysing.

You have access to multi-view camera images of a vehicle: (1) front view (which you should focus on with the most attention) <image>, (2) front right view <image>, (3) front left view <image>, (4) back view <image>, (5) back left view <image>, and (6) back right view <image>.

Please describe the scene content and provide a formatted output for the environment description :

### Environment Description:
- **E_weather**: Describe the weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy, snowy, etc.), and explain its impact on visibility and vehicle traction.
- **E_time**: Describe the time of day (e.g., daytime or nighttime), and explain how it affects driving strategies due to visibility changes.
- **E_road**: Describe the type of road (e.g., urban road or highway), and explain the challenges associated with it for driving.
- **E_lane**: Describe the current lane positioning and possible maneuvers, particularly focusing on lane selection and control decisions.

### Scenario Categories:
- Based on the scene information, tag the category that matches the scene from the following classifications (you can choose multiple categories if applicable):
categories = [
    "Road Construction",
    "Close-range Cut-ins",
    "Roundabout",
    "Animals Crossing Road",
    "Traffic Police Officers",
    "Blocking Traffic Lights",
    "Cutting into Other Vehicle",
    "Ramp",
    "Debris on the Road",
    "Narrow Roads",
    "Pedestrians Popping Out",
    "People on Bus Posters",
    "Complex Intersections",
    "Near Multiple Vehicles",
    "On Pickup Dropoff",
    "Turning at Intersection",
    "Waiting for Traffic Lights",
    "Emergency Vehicles",
    "Parking Lot",
]

Your output format should be a json object with the following structure:
{{
    "E_weather": "$$weather condition$$",
    "E_time": "$$judged by the brightness of the image$$",
    "E_road": "$$road type, can be a list of multiple tags$$",
    "E_lane": "$$lane positioning and possible maneuvers, in less than 3 words$$",
    "Scenario Category": $$category most matching the scene based on the pic you see$$",
    "More description"ï¼š$$brief additional details about the scene$$"
}}

Be focus on providing accurate and relevant information. Think step by step, first extract the caption for these images, then analyze the scene content, and finally provide a detailed description of the scene. In the end, summarize your ideas into the above json format.
