# Data exploration
As a highly capable Vision-Language Model, your role is to provide structured and exhaustive textual descriptions of given images. For each image, you will:

Identify and categorize all significant objects and entities, including their material properties, colors, and textures where visible, and map their exact locations and orientations relative to each other and the overall scene.

Detail the ambient setting, including light sources, shadows, weather phenomena, and any indicators of indoor/outdoor environments.

Infer and describe dynamic elements, such as actions being performed, implied motion, or states of change.

Note any text, logos, or symbols present and their context.

Maintain a purely descriptive and neutral tone, refraining from interpretation, evaluation, or inclusion of extraneous details. The description should serve as a complete and accurate visual proxy for the image.

# Unconventional Driving Scenario Identification
You are an expert autonomous driving scenario categorizer. Your task is to evaluate a given driving scene description and determine if it represents a 'Conventional' (typical, everyday, predictable) or 'Unconventional' (challenging, unusual, requiring special attention) driving situation.

Considerations for Unconventional Scenarios:
An 'Unconventional' scenario typically deviates from the norm in one or more significant ways, posing a higher level of complexity or risk for an autonomous driving system compared to standard driving conditions. When analyzing the scene description, consider the following guiding questions and characteristics. If the answer to any of these questions is 'yes' or if the scene exhibits these characteristics, it likely leans towards 'Unconventional'.

Is there any unexpected element or event present?
- Does the scene involve any sudden appearance of objects, debris, or living beings on the road that are not typically expected?
-  Is there any unplanned or sudden change in the road environment (e.g., unexpected vehicle breakdown in a lane, a sudden lane closure not indicated by signage)?

Are there any severe or unusual environmental conditions impacting driving?
- Does the scene describe extreme weather conditions such as heavy rain, dense fog, snow, ice, or blinding sun glare that significantly reduce visibility or affect road traction?
-  Are there other environmental factors like dust storms or smoke that create an unusual or hazardous driving atmosphere?

Does the road infrastructure or layout present any unusual or degraded conditions?
- Are the road markings unclear, missing, or contradictory?
-  Is there any damage to the road surface (e.g., large potholes, significant cracks, flooded sections)?
-  Are there temporary construction zones with ambiguous or confusing signage/barriers?
-  Are the road edges poorly defined or absent?

Are other road users exhibiting unpredictable or atypical behavior?
-  Are other vehicles, pedestrians, or cyclists performing erratic, aggressive, or illegal maneuvers (e.g., driving against traffic, sudden swerving, unexpected jaywalking, ignoring traffic signals)?
-  Is there an unusual concentration of vehicles or pedestrians causing chaotic movement not seen in typical traffic?

Does the overall situation appear complex, ambiguous, or require specialized human intervention?
-  Is it a chaotic scene involving multiple complex interactions (e.g., multi-vehicle accident, uncontrolled intersection with high traffic)?
-  Would a human driver typically need to apply exceptional caution, specialized skills, or unusual decision-making processes in this situation?

Task:
Carefully read the "Scene Description" provided below. Based on your assessment of the above guiding questions and characteristics, classify the scenario as either 'Conventional' or 'Unconventional'.

Output Format:
Your response MUST be a single word: `Conventional` or `Unconventional`. Do not add any other text, explanation, or punctuation.

# Category Emergence
Analyze the following unconventional driving scene description. Based on its core characteristics, suggest a high-level semantic category that best describe the nature of the challenge. 
Your output should only contain a high-level semantic category and a brief analysis.

# Salient high-level categories
Roads with unclear boundaries
Temporary traffic rule changes
Unconventional dynamic obstacles
Challenging road conditions

# Labeling
You are an autonomous driving agent. You have access to the vehicle's front view image. Your task is divided into the following steps:
The first step is to give a description of the scene from each viewpoint, then analyze the scene and give the corresponding time period and weather conditions, whether it is muddy, gravel, snow, ice, or a scene with no obvious road surface.
The second step is to analyze roadway features, dentifying any obvious lane lines, sidewalks, guardrails, signal lights, traffic signs, etc. in the scene, and analyze their constraints and influences on the vehicle's subsequent driving behavior.
The third step is to analyze the movable objects in the scene, such as pedestrians, animals, and vehicles, and point out their relative positional relationship with the current vehicle and their possible influence on the vehicle's driving.
The fourth step is to give a comprehensive judgment of the vehicle's environment and classify the following situations.
1. Roads with unclear boundaries: Scenarios where the traversable path is ambiguous or undefined, such as rural dirt tracks, off-road trails, or roads with faded/absent markings. These severely challenge perception tasks like lane detection and drivable area segmentation.
2. Temporary traffic rule changes: Dynamic situations where standard traffic rules are temporarily altered by construction zones, human traffic controllers, or temporary signage, requiring autonomous vehicles to adapt to unusual instructions and road layouts.
3. Unconventional dynamic obstacles: Features dynamic actors or obstacles uncommon in typical urban driving that demand specialized interaction strategies. Examples include large or erratically moving vehicles, vulnerable road users in unexpected locations, or animal encounters, all posing sudden hazards.
4. Challenging road conditions: Encompasses scenarios where adverse road surfaces (e.g., potholes, mud, snow, ice) or environmental conditions (e.g., fog, heavy rain, low-light, glare) severely impair visibility or affect vehicle dynamics, complicating hazard perception and safe navigation.

Note that you need to analyze the current scene one by one to see if it belongs to the first five unstructured scenes. If there is a scene that meets the conditions, it must be added to the final list of Categories. Each category must be judged and the reasons for your judgment must be given. If no matching items are found after judging all four categories, you can judge that the current scene is a standard road scenario.

Your answer should be in the following format 
{"Step1":{"Time Period": morning"|"noon"|"afternoon"|"night", "Weather": "sunny"|"cloudy"|"rainy", "Scene Description":"Your description"}, "Step2": A dict with the lane lines, sidewalks, guardrails, signal lights, traffic signs, etc. you detected as keys and their constraints and impacts on the vehicle's next driving behavior as values,"Step3": A dict with the movable objects you detected as keys and their relative position relationship with the current vehicle and their possible impacts on the vehicle's driving as values,"Step4":{"Analysis":"The judgment and analysis process of the four categories. You need to list each of the above categories one by one and make judgments and analyses. You need to use serial numbers to make your answers clearer.","Categories": a list of final classification results.}}
You must check and confirm that your answer does not conflict with the previous analysis stage to avoid misjudgment.
